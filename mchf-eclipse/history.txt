- start: I used mcHF Firmware Source 219.19 from Clint KA7OEI as base of new mchf-firmware-community working with GITHUB

08/19/2015 (DF8OE)
- added detection of SI570 hardware address (possible addresses 0x50 / 0x55)
- added workaround for malfunction of startupfrequency detection during unattended boots or bootloops
- merging Eclipse and CooCox configuration to one package so that both IDEs can be used

09/07/2015 (DF8OE)
- created makefile (thanks to DL4SAI)
- commented out of some curious lines which prevent building using makefile
- building is now possible with makefile but there is one issue to find:
  firmware binary is 600 bytes shorter than binary generated by eclipse and does only show splashscreen, then ends

09/08/2015 (DF8OE)
- makefile is now working

09/09/2015 (DF8OE)
- I merged Clint KA7OEI new released version 219.22. This new version now is named 219.23 and will be the base
  for all future firmware developments - I hope...

09/15/2015 (DF8OE)
- added autodetection of HY28A / HY28B in SPI mode (hardware changing needed --> see wiki on github pages

09/30/2015 (DF8OE)
- creation aof new bootloader which allows firmware updates via USB-key

10/02/2015 (DF8OE)
- minor bugfixes in bootloader

10/10/2015 (KA7OEI)
- added "Load EEPROM default": Press-and-hold F1+F3+F5 on power-up, read and follow in-screen instructions
- bugfix "bandwidth indicator sometimes wrong when band was changed"

10/11/2015: Release of Version 219.24

10/28/2015 Version 0.0.219.26  [KA7OEI]
- Added "Load Defaults" obtained by holding F1, F3 AND F5 on power-up.  Once unit has
powered up, the user would DISCONNECT power to preserve the OLD settings or PRESS-AND-HOLD the
POWER button to save the new (default) settings to EEPROM and power down.  The unit halts on this
screen indefinitely.  Some defaults changes to be more useful.
- Added "button test" function where pressing-holding any button (other than power) during power-up will
display the button being being pressed (or the one with highest precedence if multiple) and the number
of buttons being pressed.
- Problem in which "PREV" and "NEXT" buttons on menu could skip last screen of "Configuration"
menu has been fixed.
- Fixed problem in which line under screen that indicates bandwidth/settings did not change under some
conditions (e.g. switching from one band to another where the same filter/settings were used, but
a different sideband was used).  Added "unconditional" update of this line when changing bands.
- Added "INVGray" and "Blue" waterfall palettes.
- Streamlined code related to DSP NR and Notch.
- Added keyboard beep.
- Completely rewrote AM demodulation to reduce CPU loading.
- Fixed problem (from 0.0.219.24) in which there were dead spots in Si570 tuning (incorrect FDCO Min/
max values).
- Added function where pressing-holding G3 will generate sidetone equivalent to CW offset, used for
"Spotting", in CW/LSB/USB modes/
- Added FM modulation/demodulation with squelch, subaudible tone encode/decode and tone burst.

- The following files have been added (I hope that I have them all here!):

  FILTERS:  iir_15k_hpf_fm_squelch.h   - Filter for squelch noise detection
            iir_2k7_tx_bpf_fm.h        - Filter for FM transmit audio

  AUDIO:    fm_dds_table.h             - DDS/NCO lookup table for FM/Subtone/Burst generation
            fm_subaudible_tone_table.h - List of subaudible tones for encode/decode

20151029 Version 0.219.26.1  [KA7OEI]
- Fixed problem with key beep on/off
- Fixed TUNE in CW mode
- Added support for change detection of "Minor" version (e.g. "219", above)

20151030 Version 0.219.26.2  [KA7OEI]
- Fixed problem with change detection of "Minor" version

20151101 Version 0.219.26.3  [KA7OEI]
- Rewrote "AGC" handler for FM mode to reduce processing overhead when in FM.  The AGC does
not actually function in FM (there is no need for it!) but the value is calculated only to drive
the S-meter.  (In 0.219.26.0-2 the S meter did not work in FM.)

20151103 Version 0.219.26.4  [KA7OEI]
- Increased size of 60 meters to accommodate some EU frequency useages
- Added function to reset frequencies/modes to default:  Press-and-hold F2 and F4 during power-up
- Added adjustment menu item "MemFreq Lim Disable".  When "ON", there are no limits imposed on
frequency bands that may be stored in each "band-memory" location.  WARNING:  This can cause bands to be
stored in random order and also make it easier to put different bands in VFO-A versus VFO-B which can
cause relay-switching/timing issues!

##################
20151111 Version 0.219.26.5  [KA7OEI]
- Fixed problem with 2.3k filter adjustment not being possible except in FM.
- Code cleanup to fix some warnings/function definitions.
##################
Comment DF8OE: 
I reverted this because of some heavy problems

20151111 [DF8OE]
- added menu "190" hardware-info
- beginning of EEPROM including (it is detected if present but not used in this version)


20151115 [DF8OE]
- I named this back-rolled version for continuity to 0.219.26.6

20151126 [DF8OE]
- completed serial EEPROM support of 24LC1025
You have to add connection between pin8 and pin3 of 24LC1025
!!! 24LC01/02/04 are too small and config data cannot fit so that they are UNSUPPORTED !!!
At first start with fitted serial EEPROM and this (or newer) firmware serial EEPROM is
autodetected and then (if memory is big enough) virtual EEPROM is copied to serial
EEPROM. From now on all write functions are done with serial EEPROM and no longer
to virtual EEPROM. You can see if at menu item #199 serial EEPROM is written in
green letters. If so, it is in use. If it is in red letters, fitted serial EEPROM do
not have enough memory for storing settings.
It is important that EEPRM is brand-new or if not it is written 0xFF to all
cells before you solder it. Autodetection depends on a completely "empty" device!

20151130 [DF8OE]
- added detection of unsopported EEPROMs

20151201 [DF8OE]
- added support for 24LC512 (64kb), 24LC1026 (128kb) and AT24CM02 (256kb). All these
can be be fitted to board without any additional changings (no wire between pin8 and
pin3 needed). Only if 24LC1025 is used this wire must be added.

20151206 [DF8OE]
- added menu item #197 "Backup Config to virtual EEPROM"
- added menu item #198 "Restore backup config to serial EEPROM"
Both items are only available i serial EEPROM is fitted. Now you can restore to
"working coniguration" if you have destroyed the acive one insteade of only
loading default values.

20151206 [DF8OE]
- added adjustment menu item #341 "Reset Ser EEPROM" to clean up misidentified EEPROM

20151214 [DF8OE]
- added touchscreen support. You have to do the following modifications:

if LCD is in parallel mode:
remove R30, R31, R32
put connections between:
R30/R33 (PC2) to TP_SDO of LCD
R31/R34 (PC3) to TP_SDI of LCD
R32/R35 (PB13) to TP_SCK of LCD
Header Pin7 (PA4) to TP_IRQ of LCD
P8 Pin1 (PA9) to TP_CS of LCD

if LCD is in SPI mode:
same as above, but do not remove R30, R31, R32 (or wires if you use HY28B in SPI mode)

You can see signal names on back side of LCD. If you have soldered and cannot remove,
ask google for a picture of backside of HY28B - there are many.

With this mod you loose DAC which was former used for rf attenuator. This signal is
unused now and I supose it never will be used in future. Intermodulation while receiving
very strong signals can be removed by modifying rf preamp for better IP3.

After modifying and applying firmware newer/equal 0.219.26.13 in hardware menu #199
touchscreen is listed. When you enter BUTTON TEST MODE coordinates are shown if
you touch LCD screen. If this test is successful, you can use touchfunctions.

At the moment the following functions are supported:
- tapping right hand waterfall/scope bar: toggling wf/scope
- tapping left hand waterfall/scope bar: toggling wf/scope magnifying x 2
- tapping at a frequency/peak shown in wf/spectrum (lower part of the wf/scope) will tune to the tapped frequency

In future much more touch-functions will be added.


20151214 [DF8OE]
- added "power off without saving settings" by pushing BAND+ and POWER simultanusly
- added possibility of power-off and reboot in button test mode

20151215 [DF8OE]
- improved data accquisition of touchscreen, now hopefully more accurate
- solved "2.3khz filter issue"

20151217 [DF8OE]
- added "working" state display for #341

2-be-continued
